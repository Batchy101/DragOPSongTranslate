# DragOPSongTranslate

Create your <i>own songs</i> to work with DragOP, with SingSong.

<b>How To Add Songs</b>

Add the text in output.txt to DragOP.js line 4160(as of 3/2/17 Beta Build) probably going to need explorer the JS file for newer/release versions.

You can look for "songList: [" in the JS file, hopefully that helps.
