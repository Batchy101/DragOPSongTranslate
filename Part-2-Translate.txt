Remember those walls I built?/n
Well, baby they're tumbling down/n
And they didn't even put up a fight/n
They didn't even make a sound/n
I found a way to let you in/n
But, I never really had a doubt/n
Standing in the light of your halo/n
I got my angel now/n
It's like I've been awakened/n
Every rule I had you breakin'/n
It's the risk that I'm taking/n
I ain't never gonna shut you out/n
Everywhere I'm looking now/n
I'm surrounded by your embrace/n
Baby, I can see your halo/n
You know you're my saving grace/n
You're everything I need and more/n
It's written all over your face/n
Baby, I can feel your halo/n
Pray it won't fade away/n
